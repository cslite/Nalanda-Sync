# Nalanda-Sync
Download material for all registered courses to your computer

## What can this do?
This project is currently in its initial stages. Right now, it can download all the files for all the registered courses to your computer.


## Important TODOs
- Handle different types of exceptions.
- Use a SQLite database to store IDs of files which are already downloaded. And download only new files.
- Download Notices and Announcements.
- Make it to auto check for updates and sync accordingly.
